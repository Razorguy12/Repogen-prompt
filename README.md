# RadAI Reports — Radiology Portal

A FastAPI + React portal for radiologists to generate AI-assisted structured reports, review and edit them, and export professional PDFs.

## Features

- **React SPA** — Landing page, doctor dashboard, multi-step report wizard, preview/edit, admin panel
- **AI Report Generation** — Groq LLM produces structured findings, impressions, and recommendations
- **Doctor-in-the-Loop** — Edit reports inline, save to database, mark as draft or final
- **Voice Dictation & PDF Uploads** — Dictate clinical impressions directly via microphone (transcribed in real-time via Groq Whisper) or upload patient history PDFs to extract findings automatically
- **Standalone Medical Scan Viewer** — Attach study scans (CT, MRI, X-ray); view scans alone in an interactive darkroom viewer with film negative inversion mode (`Invert (Film)`) and zoom controls without cluttering the written report
- **Clean Unicode PDF Export** — High-resolution ReportLab PDF generation with TrueType Unicode font support (`LiberationSans`) and text sanitization (no missing glyphs or black blocks)
- **Mobile-Responsive UI** — Fully responsive mobile design with natural non-sticky scrolling navigation and responsive drawer menu
- **Modality Templates** — Quick-start templates for CT Chest, MRI Brain, Ultrasound, and more
- **JWT Auth** — Secure login with role-based admin user management

## Setup

### 1. Backend

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add GROQ_API_KEY (and optionally DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY)
```

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run build   # production build → web/dist/
```

### 3. Run

**Development** (recommended — hot reload for frontend):

```bash
# Terminal 1 — API
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload

# Terminal 2 — React dev server (proxies /api to :8000)
cd web && npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`

**Production** (single server serves API + built SPA):

```bash
cd web && npm run build
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`

API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
